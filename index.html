            <p class="aboutMe"> My name is Sean Tumulak-Nguyen and I grew up in Anchorage, Alaska. Over the years, I
                moved due to my parents' divorces and remarries, which ultimately led me to put my "Start" line here in
                Charlotte, NC. </p>
            <p class="aboutMe"> I enjoy going to the gym and working up a sweat. The downside is I do not eat well
                enough to show for my effort in the gym. I know I eat horribly, but food is too good! I think of all
                things I enjoy is to be against the majority, but still have the capabilities to be a part of the
                majority if I so choose. For example, there are very few people who would confess to reading "The
                Satanic Bible" just because they are curious of the mindset. Psst...it's in my nightstand and I'm not
                finished.</p>
            <p class="aboutMe"> More importantly, I am attending this bootcamp to be more marketable in the workspace. I
                currently have six years of experience as a Systems Administrator and wanted to gain the knowledge to
                progress in a line toward DevOps however I am taking one step at a time. Hopefully at the end of this
                course, I learn the skillset and knowledge to progress a few more stepping stones.</p>
